->First install SUMO. Since the last version of SUMO is not yet well documented and older version was used, sumo-0.32.0. Download from following link:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/sumo/files/sumo/version%200.32.0/sumo-all-0.32.0.tar.gz/download

extract folder and run
$ ./configure
$ make

add the folder location to PATH in .bashrc
$ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:<path to file>/sumo-0.32.0' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc

->After that install OMNet++. the most recent version worked for me (5.4.1-Linux). Download from

$ make

add the folder location to PATH in .bashrc
